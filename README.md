# GradientDescentInPython
This is python version of gradient descent.
- prerequisite for running the code:
    - python installed
    - numpy
    
- concepts for writting the code:
  - algebra for deriving equation that will define relationship between feature and target variable.
  - calculus for calculating deravative or slope of line which will be used for optimal m and b value(coefficient of data features)
  - basic python and numpy array.
